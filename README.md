# AI Economy Game: A Strategy Game of Encrypted AI Agents 

The **AI Economy Game** immerses players in a thrilling multiplayer strategy environment where individuals create and train their own AI trading agents. These agents utilize **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**, allowing them to compete in a simulated economy securely. Players strategize in a competitive landscape reminiscent of stock and cryptocurrency markets, where their FHE-encrypted AI agents execute complex trading strategies in real-time.

## The Challenge in Gaming and AI

As the popularity of online gaming and AI applications continues to rise, so does the need for privacy, security, and trust. Traditional game mechanics allow players to interact openly, but this raises concerns about the exploitation of sensitive data, especially in financial simulations. Players want assurance that their strategies and AI designs remain confidential, even in a competitive setting. The absence of such security measures can hinder innovation and fair play.

## Enter the FHE Solution 

**Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology** is a game-changer that addresses privacy concerns directly. In the **AI Economy Game**, players' AI trading strategies are FHE encrypted, allowing them to operate in a simulated market while keeping their tactics confidential. By leveraging Zama's open-source libraries such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, we provide a secure environment where players can innovate without fear of disadvantage or data theft. The unique combination of FHE and competitive gameplay offers both excitement and peace of mind.

## Key Features

- **FHE-Encrypted AI Strategies**: Players design AI trading strategies that remain private, ensuring that competitors cannot reverse-engineer or exploit them.
- **Simulated Market with Homomorphic Execution**: Engage in a vibrant marketplace where trades are processed securely and transparently.
- **Integration of AI Design with Financial Gaming**: Experience a high-level competition where algorithmic trading meets strategic gameplay.
- **Interactive Market Leaderboards**: Track other players’ performance and strategies through dynamic rankings.
- **Deep and Competitive Gameplay**: A rich environment designed for players who enjoy strategic encounters and algorithmic challenges.

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable applications.
- **Hardhat**: A development environment for Ethereum-based smart contracts.
- **Zama FHE SDK**: The core library for implementing Fully Homomorphic Encryption in our project.
- **Solidity**: The programming language for writing smart contracts.

## Installation Guide

To set up the **AI Economy Game** on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Download the project files to your local directory.
2. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed. If you don't have it, please download and install it from the official Node.js website.
3. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal (command line).
4. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This command will also fetch the required libraries for Zama FHE, enabling secure execution of your AI strategies.

## Build & Run Guide

After installation, you can build and run the project using the following commands:

1. **Compile the smart contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run tests** to ensure everything is functioning as expected:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Start the local development server**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

### Example Usage

Here's a simple code snippet demonstrating how to create a new AI agent and encrypt its trading strategy:

```javascript
const { FHEClient } = require('zama-fhe');

async function createAndEncryptAI() {
    const client = new FHEClient();
    const tradingStrategy = {
        type: 'arbitrage',
        parameters: { threshold: 1.5, maxTrades: 10 },
    };
    
    // Encrypt the trading strategy
    const encryptedStrategy = await client.encrypt(tradingStrategy);
    
    console.log("Encrypted AI Trading Strategy: ", encryptedStrategy);
}

// Run the function
createAndEncryptAI();
```

This snippet initializes a FHE client, encrypts a sample trading strategy, and logs the encrypted version, ensuring that the strategy remains private and secure.
